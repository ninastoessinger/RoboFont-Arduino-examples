# RoboFont-Arduino-examples
Various little experiments with RoboFont and an Arduino.

These little scripts require Andy Clymer’s [ControlBoard](https://github.com/andyclymer/ControlBoard) extension to run. 
Please look [on the ControlBoard page](https://github.com/andyclymer/ControlBoard) how to set up your Arduino (and the buttons on it). 
Andy has also started putting together a great guide on how to get started and [what you need](https://github.com/andyclymer/ControlBoard/wiki/Shopping-List) if you’re new to Arduino.
